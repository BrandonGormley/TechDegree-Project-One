            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I started to learn code back in January of this year, 2019. I started by learning the fundamentals HTML
                and CSS. Ever since I saw that I wrote "code" and then saw it in the web browser, I was instantly
                hooked.</p>
            <p>This then lead to me designing a website and spending hours on how to get it uplaoded to the web for
                friends and family to see. This process of learning what web hosting, domains, and FTP were was very
                stressful but rewarding. The amount of "ah-ha" moments I had were endless.</p>
